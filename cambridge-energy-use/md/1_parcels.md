## Parcels

The parcel map contains all of the property parcels in Cambridge. Each parcel has a unique Map and Lot ID number that links it to a record in the Assessing Department's Vision database system. Parcel map was created for internal use by the Assessing Department to provide a visual reference associated with each parcel in the CAMA database. Created for interdepartmental and external use as part of the web viewers on the City's website. Also created for addressing/geocoding needs, although the Buildings and Master Address List are currently more accurate than Parcels. (City of Cambridge)
