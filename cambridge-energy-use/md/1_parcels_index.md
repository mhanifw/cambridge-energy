## Parcel index

Parcel index contains polygons that split the City of Cambridge into 286 city blocks. Each block boundary is associated with an Assessors map, and a group of parcels. Each individual parcel has a map and lot associated to it. The 'map' refers to one of these blocks, the 'lot' is the tax parcel within the block. Parcel index map was created for reference purposes for the Assessing Department to group contiguous or geographically grouped parcels bounded by street centerlines
